In the Header section, I used the Pure React Carousel library.

### Cards

In the Cards section, I used the possibilities of the grid system in sass. This allows the cards to dynamically adjust to the size of the page without having to style them for different screens.

### Gallery

In the gallery I used the Simple React Lightbox library. When you click on a photo thumbnail, the original photo is displayed. SRL allows you to conveniently view photos and download them, it also has a built-in auto-play function.
